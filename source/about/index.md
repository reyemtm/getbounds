**getBounds** is a blog by Malcolm Meyer on all topics geospatial. It focuses on open source desktop and web-based geospatial programming.

    getBounds() //Returns the lat/lng bounds of the current map view, path or polyline

This site is powered by ~~Jekyll~~ Hexo, stored on GitHub ~~and cached by Cloudflare~~ and hosted by Netlify . It was ~~adapted from the Bulma Hero Theme~~ adapted from the default Hexo theme using the Chota css framework. The first generation of this blog was based on the Clean Blog theme from Start Bootstrap. In 2017 I switched from Bootstrap to Bulma CSS for something new, and to utilize a lighter CSS framework. In my continuing frustrations with Jekyll I decided to move to a JavaScript-based static site generator and chose Hexo. I also switched to the even lighter and simpler Chota css framework.
