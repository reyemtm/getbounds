    description: "An exploration of the Mapbox GL JS 3D terrain functions, using the tallest US mountain peaks in each state as the study subject. Each map view in this demo project was carefully selected to provide an excellent view of the peak and its surroundings. The terrain extrusion still has a tendency to crash browsers."
