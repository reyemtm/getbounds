    description: "This project is based on the amazing map [Brazilian Lupa](https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/lupa/epicentro/en/). It uses a dot density visualization to represent deaths from US COVID-19 clustered in one geographic area. The populations are based on US Census Block Groups, with one dot representing 20 US deaths. All statistics are generated client-side using vector tiles and web-workers"
