This presentation was given at the Northeast Ohio GIS Sympoisum on August 25, 2016. The primary objective was to give an overview of using [LeafletJS](http://leafletjs.com/index.html) in the real world, using actual data. In addition, I show a quick example using [TurfJS](http://turfjs.org/), and show how this can all be tied together for quick map iteration using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) templates.

*It is a [reveal](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) presentation, so 'f' takes you to fullscreen. See the link for other keyboard shortcuts.*
