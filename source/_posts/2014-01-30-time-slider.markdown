This video shows the growth of urban infrastructure from 1850 (blue) through to the present (red). I utilized the time/timeslider/export video feature of ArcMap to produce the video. I suffered numerous crashes while attempting to utilize the time slider in a meaningful way into my actual production mxd, though I use several third party extensions which may interfere with native ArcMap features. Still I find this simple project mesmerizing.

If you want to utilize the time feature, you must have either a string field with a four-digit year or a date field. You can enable time on multiple features, but I only had the one to work with.
