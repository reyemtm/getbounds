title: Web Maps from Scratch
description: >-
  This workshop/presentation is a ground-level introduction to the mapping api
  behind Facebook Live’s interactive map, Flikr’s world map, and maps used by
  NPR, USA Today, Evernote, Pinterest, and many other organizations and
  governments world-wide. We go over the basics of building a fullscreen web
  map, from adding data, styling, interaction, and basic GIS analysis in the
  browser. We cover Leaflet, GitHub and Jekyll.
