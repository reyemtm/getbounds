title: 'From the Ashes of Shapefiles'
subtitle: 'A Presentation for the 2020 Virtual Oio GIS Conference'
description: >-
  This talk describes the slow and painful migration from a legacy GIS data structure of hundreds of shapefiles to a modern setup using a mix of Postgres, QGIS and ArcPro. Many small organizations and municipalities face this issue and it is one that is sure to resonate even with those supporting a large enterprise GIS. From shapefiles to File Geodatabases to SQL Server Express and beyond, I will detail my quest including lessons learned, achievements made, issues encountered along the way, and what we have planned for the future.
