Creating a 'hover' effect is a great way to add interactivity to web maps. In mapbox-gl there are two main methods to accomplish this feature: ``setFeatureState()`` and ``setFilter()``. Up until now (late 2019) I had been using the ``setFilter`` method to create a highlight and hover effect for my production web maps. These maps relied on vector-tiles generated by Mapbox, which (at the time) did not contain unique feature IDs and therefore did not work with the feature-state method. An example of this can be found [here](https://bl.ocks.org/reyemtm/400485be6027f197952e073ac0658be4).

In my current setup, the ``setFilter`` method works by adding a copy of the active layer to the map. To achieve the highlight effect the layer filter is set to a unique field of the layer from the clicked or moused-over feature. An example of this method is shown in the map below.

Although this method works, if the user moves quickly across the map, the filter takes a few seconds to 'catch-up'. If this method is used just for highlighting clicked features, this lag may not be noticeable, however it is not well suited for a hover effect.

In the fall of 2019 the my production setup moved to self-hosted vector tiles, so this seemed like a perfect opportunity to test out the feature-state method. This method works similar to the filter method in that a duplicate layer is again added to the map. The duplicate layer is added to avoid having to create feature-state paint properties in all the map layers - the ``highlight`` layer is set to transparent and only highlighted on hover.
