The following are my very incomplete and abridged notes from talks I attended at the 2016 FOSS4GNA Conference in Raleigh, NC. They were created in my new favorite tool [laverna.cc](https://laverna.cc).

## IntraMaps ROAM
 - Runs offline, based on QGIS
 - Easy to use GPS collection ap
 - Runs on Windows

## Moving from Raster to Vector Tiles
 - PostGIS on AWS/S3 using TileStache
 - AngularJS to save edits back to the database
 - On the fly restyling of the vector tiles

## Web Maps/Spatial Analysis
 - [JavaScript Topology Suite](https://github.com/bjornharrtell/jsts)
 - Leaflet vector tile slicer
  - Leaflet 1.0 vector tile support

## HOT OSM
 - Cool project, look into the GIS user group doing a Mapathon  
 - http://openmapkit.org/

## RedHat
### Books
 - Cultivating Communities of Practice
 - The Open Organization
 - Give and Take

## Cartography for Big Data

- *Deep Insights*
 - Can this dashboard be created client-side using Turf?
- Check out webinars
- Maps may not always be beautiful AND functional

## State of GeoNode
 - http://geonode.kartoza.com

## Climbing the Mountain
#### Scaling and optimizing the delivery of vector tles
Jake Guthmiller - **mySidewalk**

- NGINX, TileStache (Mapzen), PostGIS and Redis Cache
- Docker

## Valhalla Open Source Routing Solution
 - Could be useful for bike/ped mapping

## Marine Protected Areas via Open Source
 - http://www.protectedseas.net
 - Leaflet & Mpbox

## NC Open Data
 - State-wide parcel mapping tool to upload and match attributes to the state schema then upload the geometry

## GIS Analysis with Vector Tiles
 - http://anandthakker.github.io/talks/foss4gna-2016/#0
 - vt-grid
 - tile-reduce

## POSSUM Red Cross
 - Awesome idea check out Missing Maps

## USA Forest Service
 -  forwarn web project/tool

## Hootenanny
 - Very cool conflation tool for different GIS data sets (OSM and MGCP)
 - Finally someone talks about MGCP data
 - Is the NGA MGCP data in the public domain?
 - Could Missing Maps or HOT use the NGA MGCP data?
  - Because the NGA is obviously using OSM data, hence this tool

## Teaching GIS
 - http://qgistutorials.com
 - New Maps Plus Univ KY grad program
 - "A Visual Guide to Map design"

## COraleigh  
 - remapping github project, others

## Kent State University
 - landscape.itreetools.org

## Healthy Cities
 - Geostats.js

## NPMap
 - Custom OSM id Editor...that writes to OSM internal instance
 - PostGIS to CartoDB sync
 - Uses Mapbox Stuio to style the baselayer and CartoDB for the POIs
 - Uses carto css mask/screen or something like that to cut out OSM data inside park boundaries
 - Maps are very simple - home, zoom and search

## Logging Roads & OSM
 - http://fix.loggingroads.org/#/task/loggingroadstartdates
 - Cool project, uses the OSM/HOT Tasker
