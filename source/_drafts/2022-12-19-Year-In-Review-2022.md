In 2022 I transitioned out of the local government sector into a new role as a solo, full-time web developer and GIS consultant. Through this process I have had the opportunity to update many of my small open source projects and learn new skills.

For my small tool `agol-cache`, a tool that allows you to download GeoJSON data from an ArcGIS Map or Feature Service, I added async/await functionality. This was a requirement for a larger client project I worked on and makes this tool that much easier to integrate into modern Node JS applications.

In addition to updating existing projects, I also took on some new challenges this year. I created a hex-grid map project, which was a fun opportunity to explore a different type of geospatial visualization. I also started learning Docker and React, which are both powerful technologies that will be valuable additions to my toolkit as a web developer.

Another highlight of the year was starting work as a solo consultant. It's been rewarding to have the opportunity to work on a variety of projects and collaborate with clients to deliver high-quality solutions.

I also had the chance to perform a website revamp for a client, which was a great opportunity to improve the user experience and make the site more visually appealing. And I added mbtiles-support to my vtile project, which will make it easier for users to work with large sets of data.

Alongside my more focused projects, I also found time to work on a new music website and explore the possibilities of text2img APIs with a side project. And I took some time to clean up my Netlify account by removing some old projects that were no longer in use.

Overall, it's been a productive and rewarding year, and I'm looking forward to continuing my professional development and tackling new challenges in the coming year.

REV II

As the year 2022 comes to a close, it's time to reflect on the past 12 months and all of the achievements and milestones I've made as a solo web developer with a focus on geospatial applications.

One of the biggest highlights of the year was updating my project agol-cache to add async/await functionality. This was a significant undertaking, but it has paid off in terms of making the project easier to use and more efficient.

Another project that I'm particularly proud of is the hex-grid map I created. This has been a popular addition to my portfolio and has garnered a lot of positive feedback from users.

In addition to working on specific projects, I also made the transition from a full-time GIS coordinator to a solo consultant. This has given me the freedom to take on a wider range of projects and work with a greater level of flexibility.

I also made some improvements to my business website and blog, giving them a fresh new look and making them more user-friendly. I'm always looking for ways to improve my online presence and make it easier for potential clients to find and contact me.

In addition to working on client projects, I also made an effort to learn new technologies this year. I started learning Docker and react, which I'm sure will be valuable skills as I continue to build web applications.

I also added mbtiles-support to my vtile project, which has been a popular request from users. And I started work on a new music website, which has been a fun and challenging project.

Even when I'm not working on paid projects, I like to keep busy with side projects and experiments. This year, I played around with text2img APIs on a side project with no funding strategy, just for the fun of it. And I cleaned up my Netlify account by removing some old projects that were no longer relevant.

One thing I considered but ultimately decided against was converting my site to Ghost. While it might have been a nice change, I didn't want to risk breaking something that was working well.

Finally, I made some improvements to my home office setup, including a standing desk and a new monitor. This has made it easier for me to work comfortably and efficiently, and I'm grateful to have a dedicated space where I can focus on my projects.

Overall, 2022 has been a great year for me as a web developer. I've learned new skills, tackled challenging projects, and made some important business decisions. I'm looking forward to continuing this journey in the coming year, and I'm excited to see what new opportunities and adventures the future holds.
